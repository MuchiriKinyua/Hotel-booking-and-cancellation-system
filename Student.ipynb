    "Hotel booking entails the process through which guests are able to schedule dates and length of stay, room preference among other specifications in a hotel. Bookings can be done physically at the hotel premises, through an agent or online etc. Recently, City and Resort Hotels have been affected by high cancellation rates among other booking trends. As a result, this has led to low revenue generation in those facilities. Since the goal of every business entity is to make profit, the cancellation rates should be dealt with and maintained as low as possible. \n",
    "In this analysis we will address the factors which have highly contributed to high hotel cancellation rates and give recommendations to the hotel owners so that they can mitigate this risk better and earn more profit. The analysis will also be useful to the consumers of the hotel facilities and thus they will be in a position to know the ideal times of the year to book for the hotel rooms, the optimal stay length that offers them best rates etc.\n",
    "The aim of this project is to analyze the Hotels data and study cancellations and their underlying patterns in order to reduce them and secure revenue. \n"

    "The hotel industry is a vital component of the global tourism sector, serving millions of travelers each year. However, this dynamic and competitive industry faces numerous challenges that demand innovative solutions and strategic interventions. \n",
    "Hotel bookings have seen a substantial shift towards online reservations over the years, largely due to factors like the convenience offered by online platforms, the wide range of options available, and increased flexibility. Today, there are multiple methods for making hotel reservations. These include using booking agencies or directly contacting the hotels. </br>\n",
    "Our goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying and forecasting hotel bookings and cancellations. This will be achieved through a comprehensive analysis of booking history, where we will consider factors such as: number of cancellations after reservation, number of reservations not canceled, travel agency used to make reservations, number of stays, market segmentation, whether corporate or travel agent, number of days in the waiting list , the average daily rate of the reservations, total number of special requests received, reservation status and arrival date.\n",
    "This predictive model will provide valuable insights into the analysis, helping us identify the seasonal trends and factors contributing to booking cancellations, such as waiting time, to ensure a more stable revenue stream. Furthermore, we shall explore opportunities for customizing loyalty programs based on customer preferences and behaviors, ultimately increasing repeat bookings.\n"
